         <p style="font-size: 17px;text-align: justify;"> We are pleased to announce that the 51st Southeast Theoretical Chemistry Association (SETCA) meeting will now be held at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC from May 11-13 of 2023. SETCA conferences have been held annually since 1970.  SETCA 2023 meeting will begin with a poster session on Thursday evening, and will run through noon on Saturday, and will be preceded by a python workshop for undergraduate chemists.
          SETCA is a loose organization of theoretical and computational chemists from across the Southeastern United States. Since its inception in 1970 by Prof. Bruno Linder of Florida State University, its primary function has been an annual conference to give faculty, students, and postdoctoral associates an opportunity to present their most recent research results.   We are looking forward to a vibrant mix of invited and contributed talks, poster presentations and scientific discussions.</p>

This lecture will provide an overview of our recent efforts to improve the description of such perturbed wave functions, from the development of field-aware densities to streamline local pair-natural orbital methods for frequency-dependent response theory to the use of local correlation techniques to reduce the cost of time-dependent coupled-cluster simulations of absorption and circular dichroism spectra."> Reduced-Scaling Coupled Cluster Theory in the Frequency and Time Domains </td>

The application of ML has brought sweeping changes across multiple chemical domains, including drug discovery and material design. Critical elements of ML and modern chemoinformatics include the development of effective molecular representations and chemical descriptors, the systematic collection of precise and standardized data, and the optimization of models for enhanced performance. Our group has developed novel molecular representations based on persistent homology, an applied branch of topology, that can encode the geometric structure and topological information of molecules for chemical applications. Application of Vietoris-Rips filtration on a molecular structure allows the automated capture of the topological features of chemical functional groups, which are further vectorized into two-dimensional matrices of fixed size (persistence images or PIs). ML models for molecular and materials discovery are developed based on chemical information included in the PIs. We have demonstrated the applicability of PIs in a high-throughput computational screening of a large molecular database (GDB-9) with more than 133,000 organic molecules, with the aim to identify novel molecules that selectively interact with CO2. In another application, PIs allowed us to explore a database of 181k Fe(IV)-oxo molecular complexes for catalyst optimization. Finally, we have developed PolymerNET, a novel multitask machine learning architecture that relies on PIs, polymeric features and graph neural networks."> Persistent Homology as a Tool for Chemical Machine Learning: A Story of Birth and Death </td>

To mitigate this issue, global efforts have been made to close the carbon circulation cycle, and to achieve a net carbon emission neutrality. Among grand technological challenges are CO2 capture, sequestration, and conversion into dense liquid fuels. Recently Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) have received attention for their possible application as solvents for capture and separation of CO2 from flue gases. Recently, we have showed that reline, a prototypical DES, can be used for separation of CO2 from N2 with 96.7% purity. We discuss the nature of interaction of CO2 and N2 with reline. We analyze dynamics, energetics, and binding motifs for a CO2 and N2 in reline employing Density Functional Theory (DFT), Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and statistical thermodynamics. We also investigate the effect of reline on the vibrational spectra of CO2 and reline. Our theoretical analysis shows that the energetic stabilization of CO2 and N2 in reline is primarily determined by the electronic structure. However, the selective absorption of CO2 over N2 in reline observed experimentally can only be fully understood once the entropic contributions to the free energy of binding in the solvent are included. Reline is just one of the large number of DESs that exist, but the qualitative features observed in our detailed simulations of reline seem likely to also be relevant in many other similar solvents."> Quantum Chemical Simulations of CO2 and N2 Capture in Reline, a Prototypical Deep Eutectic Solvent </td>

By modelling triglycine peptide formation in the prebiotic atmosphere, we provide a plausible pathway for peptide growth. By examining four different triglycine transition states, we conclude that the formation of diglycine and triglycine in atmospheric nanoclusters of water in the prebiotic atmosphere kinetically favors adding by an N-to-C synthesis of glycines through a trans conformation. Addition of six waters stabilizes the TS structure and lowers the Gibbs free activation energy by 13 kcal/mol at 217 K, which is equivalent to a rate speed up of roughly 13 orders of magnitude. At temperatures that model the prebiotic atmosphere temperature range, the water catalyzed free energies of activation are predicted to be 4.7 kcal/mol at 259 K and 2.6 kcal/mol at 273 K for the six water nanocluster. Examination of the trans vs cis six water transition states reveals that a homodromic water network that maximizes the acceptor/donor nature of the six waters is responsible for the trans N-to-C pathway being kinetically favored. Nature uses the trans N-to-C pathway to synthesize proteins in the ribosome, and we note the similarities between the transition state for peptide synthesis in the ribosome and the transition states formed in nanoclusters of water in the same pathway. These results support the hypothesis that small oligomers formed in a prebiotic atmosphere and potentially rained down onto earth’s surface."> Prebiotic Peptide Formation in Atmospheric Nanoclusters of Water: The Triglycine System </td>

            <td data-toggle="tooltip" title="A power of atomistic modeling in materials discovery lies in its demonstrated ability to establish a correspondence between atomic structure of the material and its optical, electrical, thermophysical, mechanical or magnetic properties. Two general categories of such modeling typically require high throughput calculations (HTC): materials screening and multistep workflows. Materials screening can be implemented employing one or several energy methods (DFT, force field, tight binding, etc.) or a hybrid scheme, energy methods combined with active learning techniques. Multistep workflows are used to address more complex multiscale properties that may require thousands of calculations even for a single system of interest. In addition to common HTC problems, industrial HTC modeling presents some additional challenges such as very pragmatic focus (addressing device performance, manufacturability, reliability, cost, etc.), expected value (including intellectual property (IP) protection), robustness, stringent project timelines, and project costs. We discuss how these problems are addressed with Schrödinger Materials Science Suite©. We have implemented streamlined yet flexible simulation setup and execution, comprehensive results validation and data analysis. Our software is capable of running a combination of approaches including combinatorial chemistry, quantum and classical molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning. We shall address the merits and challenges of HTC in the materials industry with specific examples in organic electronics and catalysis."> High throughput atomistic modeling in industry: Merits and challenges </td>

Our understanding of the determinants of and variations within copolymer sequences, even in simple step-growth reactions, remains limited. Here, we perform simulations on a generic model of an irreversible step-growth copolymerization between two types of monomers, A and B, in solution. Our results demonstrate that attractions among the nascent oligomers can exert considerable influence over the sequential arrangement of monomers in the final set of copolymers and any assemblies they form. The observed effects cannot be fully accounted for within conventional polymerization theories but can be readily explained by a phase separation between A-rich and B-rich segments that emerges from and is limited by the copolymerization process itself. In addition, we investigate the interplay between differing non-bonded attractions and activation energies as well as the influence of chain stiffness, selective solvent conditions, and sequence seeding on the resulting co-oligomer sequences and their aggregates.">  On the Collective Behaviors of Oligomers: Implications for Copolymer Sequences </td>

            <td data-toggle="tooltip" title="A major bottleneck in synthetic enzyme design is the engineering of a stable and functional protein scaffold. Efforts to mimic natural enzyme scaffolds are only partially successful due to the complexity of reproducing such intricate folded structures that also need to be flexible and dynamic. In natural enzymes, these structurally and dynamically complex scaffolds induce strong electrostatic interactions in the active site, stabilizing the reaction transition state, which lowers the energy barrier and accelerate reaction kinetics (electrostatic preorganization theory). Thus far, the designed scaffolds of synthetic enzymes do not exhibit similar electrostatic properties, resulting in limited rate accelerations. While scaffold modifications (i.e., mutations of the protein sequence) can help to improve on the original design, the process is often tedious, expensive and rarely efficient.
In this talk, I will present an alternative for improving synthetic enzymes that relies on designing a DNA scaffolding. Within electrostatic preorganization theory, enzyme catalysis is governed by both short-range (from the active site) and long-range (from the scaffold and beyond) electrostatic interactions. Here, the polar sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA induces further long-range electrostatic interactions in the active site, accelerating reaction kinetics. I will illustrate this concept by showing how DNA fragments are predicted to lower the reaction barrier by 2.0 kcal/mol in the active site of synthetic enzyme KE15.

A PES represents the relationship between the chemical system’s energy and its geometry and can provide useful information about the system’s reactivity and chemical or photochemical properties. Typically, full-dimensional PESs are used to perform molecular dynamics simulations to obtain insights into the reactivity or excited-state dynamics of chemical systems of interest. In this talk, I will describe how one can employ sparse-grid interpolation techniques to construct reduced-dimensional PESs along the preselected degrees of freedom and uElize them to run molecular dynamics or surface-hopping simulaEons in order to obtain insights into the dynamical behavior of molecules."> Potential Energy Surface as a Tool for Understanding Dynamical Behavior of Molecules </td>

Protein tyrosine phosphatases provide an excellent model system to study this issue, as in addition to their crucial biological role as regulators of cellular signaling, their activity is regulated by the motion of a mobile loop, the WPD-loop, that appears to be linked to the chemical step of catalysis. Using a variety of computational techniques we have dissected the motion of this loop and it's link to chemistry, including the role of sequence in allowing this loop to display unusual shifts in pH-dependency and conformational states. When combined with biochemical, structural and biophysical characterization, our data highlight the importance of the correlated motion of multiple enzyme loops in catalysis by protein tyrosine phosphatases, as a model system for understanding the role of loop dynamics in catalysis and evolvability more generally."> Loop Dynamics and Catalysis in Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases </td>
